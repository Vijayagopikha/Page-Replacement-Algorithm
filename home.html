        <p>In an operating system that uses paging for memory management, a page replacement algorithm is needed to decide which page needs to be replaced when a new page comes in. Page replacement becomes necessary when a page fault occurs and there are no free page frames in memory. However, another page fault would arise if the replaced page is referenced again. Hence it is important to replace a page that is not likely to be referenced in the immediate future. If no page frame is free, the virtual memory manager performs a page replacement operation to replace one of the pages existing in memory with the page whose reference caused the page fault. </p>

            <h1>FIFO</h1>
            <p>This is the simplest page replacement algorithm. In this algorithm, the operating system keeps track of all pages in the memory in a queue, the oldest page is in the front of the queue. When a page needs to be replaced page in the front of the queue is selected for removal.After filling up of the frames, the next page in the waiting queue tries to enter the frame.</p>

        </div>
        <div class = "card">
            <h1>OPT</h1>
            <p>This is the second basic algorithm of Page Replacement Algorithms. This algorithm is basically dependent on the number of frames used. Then each frame takes up the certain page and tries to access it. When the frames are filled then the actual problem starts. The fixed number of frames is filled up with the help of first frames present. This concept is fulfilled with the help of Demand Paging. </p>

        <div class = "card">
            <h1>LRU</h1>
            <p>This is the last basic algorithm of Page Replacement Algorithms. This algorithm is basically dependent on the number of frames used. Then each frame takes up the certain page and tries to access it. When the frames are filled then the actual problem starts. The fixed number of frames is filled up with the help of first frames present. This concept is fulfilled with the help of Demand Paging. </p>
